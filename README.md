# FlBackend-flow-Distribution-Algorithm

This code defines the data structures for astrologers and users, as well as the flow distribution algorithm. The algorithm distributes users among astrologers based on their flow rates, and adjusts the flow for top astrologers based on user preferences. The API endpoints allow for controlling the flow distribution and toggling settings for top astrologers.

To set up this system, you would need to:

1. Install Node.js and the required dependencies (e.g., Express.js).
2. Create a database to store the astrologer and user data (e.g., PostgreSQL or MongoDB).
3. Implement the flow distribution algorithm and API endpoints in a Node.js backend.
4. Integrate the algorithm into the backend system to handle user requests and manage flow distribution.
5. Write test cases to validate the functionality of the algorithm.
6. Document the flow distribution algorithm, its design principles, and how to interact with the API endpoints.
